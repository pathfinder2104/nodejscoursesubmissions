# NodeJS Course Assignments.

Going through the course of NodeJS on coursera, this repo is for assignments submission.

### Module-1 Assignment CSV to JSON 
I have read the file line by line for which I had to search for some help. I found that there is a readline module which is a core module in NodeJS and I have used it. I read the file line by line and then I have created a JSON object of each line and stored that JSON object in a global object *`JSON_STORE`*.

I have kept the CSV file with the project it self and I have used tested the project by running the actual project file. No test cases are written.
